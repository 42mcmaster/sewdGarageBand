## Verse 1

```
     G
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks 
           C
Dressed in Holiday style 
       D                        G
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
         G
Children laughing, people passing 
        C
Meeting smile after smile 
       D                       G
And on every street corner you hear
```

## Chorus

```
G             C
Silver bells, silver bells 
D                          G
It's Christmas-time in the city 
G            C
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
D                         G
Soon it will be Christmas Day
```

## Verse 2

```
           G
Strings of street lights, even stop lights 
        C
Blink a bright red and green 
       D                            G
As the shoppers run home with their treasures 
         G
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch 
        C
This is Santa's big scene 
     D                       G
And above all the bustle you hear...
```

## Chorus

```
G             C
Silver bells, silver bells 
D                          G
It's Christmas-time in the city 
G            C
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
D                         G
Soon it will be Christmas day
```
